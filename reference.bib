abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BackgroundMixed-reality technologies, including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) , are considered to be promising potential tools for science teaching and learning processes that could foster positive emotions, motivate autonomous learning, and improve learning outcomes. Methods In this study, a technology-aided biological microscope learning system based on VR/AR is presented. The structure of the microscope is described in a detailed three-dimensional (3D) model, each component being represented with their topological interrelationships and associations among them being established. The interactive behavior of the model was specified, and a standard operating guide was compiled. The motion control of components was simulated based on collision detection. Combined with immersive VR equipment and AR technology, we developed a virtual microscope subsystem and a mobile virtual microscope guidance system. Results The system consisted of a VR subsystem and an AR subsystem. The focus of the VR subsystem was to simulate operating the microscope and associated interactive behaviors that allowed users to observe and operate the components of the 3D microscope model by means of natural interactions in an immersive scenario. The AR subsystem allowed participants to use a mobile terminal that took a picture of a microscope from a textbook and then displayed the structure and functions of the instrument, as well as the relevant operating guidance. This flexibly allowed students to use the system before or after class without time and space constraints. The system allowed users to switch between the VR and AR subsystems. Conclusions The system is useful for helping learners (especially K-12 students) to recognize a microscope's structure and grasp the required operational skills by simulating operations using an interactive process. In the future, such technology-assisted education would be a successful learning platform in an open learning space.},

abstract = {Purpose: The subject of the article is the concept of augmented intelligence, which constitutes a further stage in the development of research on artificial intelligence. This is a new phenomenon that has rarely been considered in the subject literature so far, which may be interesting for the fields of social sciences and humanities. The aim is to describe the features of this technology and determine the practical and ethical problems associated with its implementation in libraries. Design/methodology/approach: The method of literature review was used. Systematic searches according to specific questions were carried out using the Scopus and Web of Science scientific databases, as well as Google Scholar and the LISTA abstract database. Findings: The results established that the issue of augmented intelligence has barely been discussed in the field of librarianship. Although this technology may be interesting as a new area of librarian research and as a new framework for designing innovative services, deep ethical consideration is necessary before this technology is introduced in libraries. Research limitations/implications: The article deals with some of the newest technologies available, and this topic is generally very rarely discussed in scientific publications in either the social sciences or humanities. Therefore, due to the limited availability of materials, the findings presented in the article are primarily of a conceptual nature. The aim is to present this topic from the perspective of librarianship and to create a starting point for further discussion on the ethical aspects of introducing new technologies in libraries. Practical implications: The results can be widely used in practice as a framework for the implementation of augmented intelligence in libraries. Social implications: The article can help to facilitate the debate on the role of implementing new technologies in libraries. Originality/value: The problem of augmented intelligence is very rarely addressed in the subject literature in the field of library and information science.},

@article{Kitto2019,
abstract = {Artificial intelligence and data analysis (AIDA) are increasingly entering the field of education. Within this context, the subfield of learning analytics (LA) has, since its inception, had a strong emphasis upon ethics, with numerous checklists and frameworks proposed to ensure that student privacy is respected and potential harms avoided. Here, we draw attention to some of the assumptions that underlie previous work in ethics for LA, which we frame as three tensions. These assumptions have the potential of leading to both the overcautious underuse of AIDA as administrators seek to avoid risk, or the unbridled misuse of AIDA as practitioners fail to adhere to frameworks that provide them with little guidance upon the problems that they face in building LA for institutional adoption. We use three edge cases to draw attention to these tensions, highlighting places where existing ethical frameworks fail to inform those building LA solutions. We propose a pilot open database that lists edge cases faced by LA system builders as a method for guiding ethicists working in the field towards places where support is needed to inform their practice. This would provide a middle space where technical builders of systems could more deeply interface with those concerned with policy, law and ethics and so work towards building LA that encourages human flourishing across a lifetime of learning. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Applied ethics has a number of well-established theoretical groundings that we can use to frame the actions of ethical agents, including, deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics. Learning analytics has developed a number of checklists, frameworks and evaluation methodologies for supporting trusted and ethical development, but these are often not adhered to by practitioners. Laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) apply to fields like education, but the complexity of this field can make them difficult to apply. What this paper adds Evidence of tensions and gaps in existing ethical frameworks and checklists to support the ethical development and implementation of learning analytics. A set of three edge cases that demonstrate places where existing work on the ethics of AI in education has failed to provide guidance. A “practical ethics” conceptualisation that draws on virtue ethics to support practitioners in building learning analytics systems. Implications for practice and/or policy Those using AIDA in education should collect and share example edge cases to support development of practical ethics in the field. A multiplicity of ethical approaches are likely to be useful in understanding how to develop and implement learning analytics ethically in practical contexts.},

abstract = {Physics education applications using augmented reality technology, which has been developed extensively in recent years, have a lot of restrictions in terms of performance and accuracy. The purpose of our research is to develop a real-time simulation system for physics education that is based on parallel processing. In this paper, we present a video see-through AR (Augmented Reality) system that includes an environment recognizer using a depth image of Microsoft's Kinect V2 and a real-time soft body simulator based on parallel processing using GPU (Graphic Processing Unit). Soft body simulation can provide more realistic simulation results than rigid body simulation, so it can be more effective in systems for physics education. We have designed and implemented a system that provides the physical deformation and movement of 3D volumetric objects, and uses them in education. To verify the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a questionnaire survey of 10 students majoring in physics education. As a result of the questionnaire survey, 93{\%} of respondents answered that they would like to use it for education. We plan to use the stand-alone AR device including one or more cameras to improve the system in the future.},

@article{Becker2017,
abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a multipurpose image analysis software based on deep learning with artificial neural networks for the detection of breast cancer in an independent, dual-center mammography data set. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, all patients undergoing mammography in 2012 at our institution were reviewed (n = 3228). All of their prior and followup mammographies from a time span of 7 years (2008-2015) were considered as a reference for clinical diagnosis. After applying exclusion criteria (missing reference standard, prior procedures or therapies), patientswith the first diagnosis of a malignoma or borderline lesion were selected (n = 143). Histology or clinical long-term follow-up served as reference standard. In a first step, a breast densityand age-matched control cohort was selected (n = 143) from the remaining patients with more than 2 years follow-up (n = 1003). The neural network was trained with this data set. From the publicly available Breast Cancer Digital Repository data set, patients with cancer and a matched control cohort were selected (n = 35 X 2). The performance of the trained neural network was also tested with this external data set. Three radiologists (3, 5, and 10 years of experience) evaluated the test data set. In a second step, the neural network was trained with all cases from January to September and tested with cases from October to December 2012 (screening-like cohort). The radiologists also evaluated this second test data set. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between readers and the neural network were compared. A Bonferronicorrected P value of less than 0.016 was considered statistically significant. Results: Mean age of patients with lesion was 59.6 years (range, 35-88 years) and in controls, 59.1 years (35-83 years). Breast density distribution (A/B/C/D) was 21/59/42/21 and 22/60/41/20, respectively. Histologic diagnoses were invasive ductal carcinoma in 90, ductal in situ carcinoma in 13, invasive lobular carcinoma in 13, mucinous carcinoma in 3, and borderline lesion in 12 patients. In the first step, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the trained neural network was 0.81 and comparable on the test cases 0.79 (P = 0.63). One of the radiologists showed almost equal performance (0.83, P = 0.17), whereas 2 were significantly better (0.91 and 0.94, P {\textless} 0.016). In the second step, performance of the neural network (0.82) was not significantly different from the human performance (0.77-0.87, P {\textgreater} 0.016); however, radiologists were consistently less sensitive and more specific than the neural network. Conclusions: Current state-of-the-art artificial neural networks for general image analysis are able to detect cancer in mammographies with similar accuracy to radiologists, even in a screening-like cohort with low breast cancer prevalence.},

This lack of visibility is the most probable cause of accidents in this context. Recent research works tend to prove that augmented reality applied to assisted driving can significantly reduce the risk of accidents. In this paper, we present a real-time marker-less system to see through cars. For this purpose, two cars are equipped with cameras and an appropriate wireless communication system. The stereo vision system mounted on the front car allows to create a sparse 3D map of the environment where the rear car can be localized. Using this inter-car pose estimation, a synthetic image is generated to overcome the occlusion and to create a seamless see-through effect which preserves the structure of the scene.},

@article{Jamali2015,
abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that augments reality with either two or three dimensional computer generated imagery (CGI), objects and/or information, and allows users to interact with them. AR on mobile devices are evolving and offer a great deal of potential in terms of learning and training. This paper discusses the development process of a mobile prototype learning environment that utilises mobile-Augmented Reality (mAR). The prototype is called the Human Anatomy in Mobile Augmented Reality or HuMAR, and the selected learning topic is the anatomy of the human skeletal structure. The main objective of HuMAR is to aid students and it could potentially enhance their learning process. There has been a report stating that there is a decline in retaining and generating long lasting information longer when learning the abovementioned topic. This paper describes the theory, concept, prototype development and results of HuMAR taken from a pilot test. The pilot test used the experimental method with science's students from three different universities. The objectives of the pilot test were to consolidate users' experience from a didactic and technical point of view. Based on the results of the pilot test, it is concluded that students were satisfied with HuMAR in terms of its usability and features; which in turn could have a positive impact in their learning process.},

@article{Chung2015,
abstract = {Abstract Augmented reality (AR) is being developed as a part of smart tourism to provide information about destinations and attractions. Its usage will maximize tourist satisfaction, based on tourists' active usage. Three aspects have been found to be factors encouraging tourists to actively utilize AR. The first aspect is technology readiness (TR) meaning that a tourist has an overall state of mind such that they are ready to use a technology. The second aspect is the visual factor of AR. The third aspect is the situational factor. Thus, this study conceptualizes these crucial factors of AR usage as well as how these influence visitors' AR usage intention and destination visit intention through their beliefs and AR attitude. We collected sample from 145 people using an AR application in Deoksugung Palace, South Korea. This study analyzed hypotheses with structural equation model. The result shows that TR was a predictor of perceived usefulness. In addition, visual appeal and facilitating conditions affected perceived ease of use. Perceived ease of use affected perceived usefulness. Finally, perceived usefulness and ease of use affected intention to use AR and to visit a destination via AR attitude. This study presented theoretical and practical implications.},

abstract = {Augmented reality is a human-machine interaction tool that presents information generated by computer on the real world using a camera. Augmented reality technology has the potential to draw students' attention to visualize a layer of information on real objects using handheld devices such as tablets and smartphones. The objective of this study was to assess students' perception of the use of augmented reality in learning microprocessor. Therefore, a mobile application was designed and developed by integrating elements of augmented reality for teaching and learning this topic. This study was conducted based on the ADDIE model that consists of five phases: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The study found that students' perception of the use of augmented reality is positive based on the average mean score. However, the disadvantage of this application is the use of images as compared to the use of real microprocessor as the learning object. An area for future study is to assess the students' perception of the use of real objects as the learning object in using mobile augmented reality application.},

abstract = {The comprehension of micro-worlds has always been the focus and the challenge of chemistry learning. Junior high school students' imaginative abilities are not yet mature. As a result, they are not able to visualize microstructures correctly during the beginning stage of chemistry learning. This study targeted "the composition of substances" segment of junior high school chemistry classes and, furthermore, involved the design and development of a set of inquiry-based Augmented Reality learning tools. Students could control, combine and interact with a 3D model of micro-particles using markers and conduct a series of inquiry-based experiments. The AR tool was tested in practice at a junior high school in Shenzhen, China. Through data analysis and discussion, we conclude that (a) the AR tool has a significant supplemental learning effect as a computer-assisted learning tool; (b) the AR tool is more effective for low-achieving students than high-achieving ones; (c) students generally have positive attitudes toward this software; and (d) students' learning attitudes are positively correlated with their evaluation of the software. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.
