People's skills are getting better as technology advances, which is in line with the fact that education is getting better day by day. One way is through augmented intelligence, where humans and technology work together to make people smarter. In this study, augmented intelligence is used to help people learn about human anatomy. This is done by using augmented reality technology to track motion, which can make 3D objects follow the motion. The platform for studying anatomy is called AIVE (Artificial Intelligence in Virtual Education).
